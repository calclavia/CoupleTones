CoupleTones is a location-based Android application that provides you with notifications when your partner (i.e.., girlfriend, boyfriend, etc.) visits one of his/her favorite locations (and vice versa).  To set up a favorite location, you click it on the map and assign it a name.  Then, later, your partner will be notified by CoupleTones when you visit the location.  The app will keep an ordered list of the locations that your partner has visited throughout the day.
